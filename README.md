# Password-Strength-estimator

This project focuses on predicting password strength using various machine learning techniques and data analysis. 
It involves analyzing a dataset of passwords and their corresponding attributes to evaluate their strength and estimate the time required to crack them.

## Project Overview

In this project, there are explored the relationships between password attributes,
including **strength**, **length**, and **entropy**, to predict the time it would take to crack a password in offline. 
The dataset used for analysis can be found in the "dataset.csv" file. 

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

## Roles in the Project:

This project was a collaborative effort between myself and Inka Croell (https://github.com/c1nka). 
My responsibilities included sourcing the dataset, creating and plotting the Polynomial Regression model, and conducting
the primary analysis of the results and conclusions, with a focus on the polynomial model.
